#                               Meet Ethyl.

I used to always lose track of my things, but then I learned to organize everything by keeping lists. Now I'm the most efficient granny around, and I can help you whippersnappers do the same!

**This is no ordinary list!** 

    - Easily create a list, and assign a category.

	-Add and remove items from your lists. Check em off as you go!
	
	-SHARE YOUR LISTS. Collaborate with friends, and see what items they have checked off the list!


Ethyl is here to show the effectiveness of something as simple as a list. Combine that with the collaborative experience of sharing, and you have a very powerful tool at your fingertips. Mobile-first developement means your lists are right at home on your phone, and more importantly always with you.




##                  Who is **Ethyl** Made for?


![A very busy person](https://www.franksonnenbergonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image_why-do-busy-people-get-stuff-done.jpg)

Ethyl believes that anyone can benefit from her experience!

**AS A USER**
AS A busy person with lots to remember
I WANT an easy way to keep track of my life and share information with others

I WANT to create lists and categorize them however I want
SO THAT I can refer back to them when I need them

I WANT to be able to easily add and check off items
SO THAT I can remember everything I need

I WANT to share these individual lists with others
SO THAT they can add or remove items and collaborate

I WANT to be able to select who I share each list with
SO THAT I can share what is relevant but still maintain privacy

I WANT to save the users that I’ve shared lists with before
SO THAT I can easily share other lists with them again

I WANT the interface to be responsive and intuitive
SO THAT it’s easy to add and review items


**Ideas for Stretch Goals, and Future Developement:**
Pin lists to the top.
Add a filter to sort lists by date created, alphabetical, length of list.
Search for lists by keywords/items in list.
Add a reminder for tasks.
Be able to send message to connected users.
Add a calendar that can be shared.
